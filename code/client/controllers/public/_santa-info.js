    question: "How does Santa Claus get around the whole world in one night?",
    answer: "<p>Recent studies have shown that Santa has a special device tucked beneath the seat in his sleigh that can he uses to freeze time. He freezes time so that he can travel all over the world in no time at all, eating all the cookies and milk he can possibly devour.</p><p>The device has yet to be named, but we do know that the device is powered by holiday cheer; the more holiday cheer there is in the world, the faster he can deliver his presents.</p>"

    question: "How does Santa Claus deliver presents to kids without a chimney?",
    answer: "<p>In today's modern society, chimneys aren't as common as they used to be. In the good old days, Santa could just tighten his belt and jump right down through each chimney, straight into the family's living room, but he's been hard at work on a solution for quite some time now.</p><p>The secret is in his boots! With just 4 taps of the heels on any hard surface, he and his crew of reindeer (and toys) shrink down small enough to sneak through any crack he can find, which is usually the keyhole. Once inside, the same 4 taps of the heels brings him back to life-size so he can deliver your presents!</p>"

    question: "How does Santa Claus feel about Florida's \"stand your ground\" law?",
    answer: "<p>Florida's law allowing folks to defend themselves and their homes against intruders has presented many problems for Santa over the years. He has tried to influence lawmakers to change this law by offering them cookies and milk and equity in the North Pole real estate market, but no one budged.</p><p>This forced the bearded-man to hole up in his laboratory to develop a bullet-proof uniform and vests for his reindeer (patent pending). If Floridians shoot at Santa, the bullets turn to marshmellows on impact, which Santa feeds to the hungry elves back at the Shop.</p>"

    name: "reindeer",
    icon: "/reindeer.svg",
    question: "Do Santa's reindeer ever get tired?",
    answer: "<p>Santa's reindeer do get tired, but very rarely. In fact, they are only active two nights out of the year â€” one night to eat and fatten up, and of course Christmas eve to pull Santa's sleigh. Pulling the fat man and his presents takes a lot of energy, so they need every second of sleep they can get before their big day!</p>"

    name: "mail-order",
    icon: "/shipping-box.svg",
    question: "What do Santa's elves do after Christmas?",
    answer: "<p>Santa's elves are busy all year round, not just at Christmas time. They keep Santa's sleigh in tip-top shape, organize things around the Shop, and just recently opened up a mail-order snow business. You though all those snow-machines produce fake snow? Nope, it's the real thing. Fresh from a top all that ancient ice at the North pole.</p>"

  {
    name: "cookies",
    icon: "/cookies.svg",
    question: "How come Santa Claus doesn't get fatter from all of the milk and cookies he eats?",
    answer: "<p>You might think Santa picks and chooses which cookies and milk to eat, but you thought wrong: he eats ALL of them. Studies show that Santa's body metabolizes food 2000x faster and more affective that the average human. Most of the year Santa is pencil thin, but the amount of cookies he eats on Christmas Eve causes him to bloat to 4x his normal size.</p><p>This is common for his race of human, of which he and Mrs. Claus are the only ones left. Other theories are being explored, including a theory that his beard is actually a separate being living on his face, and a few special scientists think Santa can self-multiply on demand.</p>"
